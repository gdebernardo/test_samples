Random implementations of simple code computing a Fibonacci from a parameter


#### fib01
fib01 is C++ code. It is built using cMake. A compile.sh script is provided

In folder fib01 do:
- Compile: `bash ./compile.sh`
- Execute: `./build/fib01 <n>` (where n is the Fibonacci number desired)

#### fib02
fib02 is C++ code. It requires boost (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html). A Makefile is provided

In folder fib02 do:
- Compile: `make all`
- Execute: `./fib02 <n>` (where n is the Fibonacci number desired)


#### fib03
fib03 is Python code. It works with any python3 distribution

To execute, in folder fib03, run: `python3 fib.py <n>` (where n is the Fibonacci number desired)

#### fib04
fib04 is Javascript code. It works with node.js 

To execute, in folder fib04, run: `node fib04.js <n>` (where n is the Fibonacci number desired)
